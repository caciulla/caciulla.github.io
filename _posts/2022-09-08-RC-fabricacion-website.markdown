## Construction Company Website

This is a project I worked on this fall. I built a website for RC Fabricaci√≥n, a small construction company in Baja California. I created every aspect of the company's public facing material, including:

-   Writing the company mission statement
-   Writing the company Summary page
-   Writing the About section
-   Designing the logo
-   Building the site locally using hugo in VS Code
-   Pushing the site to a GitHub repository
-   Deploying the site using Cloudflare.io

The needs of the company were satisfied with a static site and free web hosting with Cloudflare. They may decide to purchase a domain name in the future.

I also translated the site to fit the customer's needs with the help of my spanish speaking partner.
