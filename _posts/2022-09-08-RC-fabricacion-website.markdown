## Portfolio - Website Project

This is a project I worked on this fall. I built a website for RC Fabricaci√≥n, a small construction company. I created every aspect of the company's public facing material, including:

-   Wrote the company mission statement
-   Wrote the company Summary page
-   Wrote the About section
-   Desiged the logo
-   Built the whole site locally using hugo in VS Code
-   Pushed the site to a GitHub repository
-   Deployed the site using Cloudflare.io
