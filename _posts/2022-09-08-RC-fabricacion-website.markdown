## Portfolio - Website Project

This is a project I worked on this fall. I built a website for RC Fabricaci√≥n, a small construction company. I created every aspect of the company's public facing material, including:

-   Writing the company mission statement
-   Writing the company Summary page
-   Writing the About section
-   Designing the logo
-   Building the site locally using hugo in VS Code
-   Pushing the site to a GitHub repository
-   Deploying the site using Cloudflare.io
