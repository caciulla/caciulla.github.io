## Amaro Crash Course Website

This project is a website that displays training material I created for a restaurant in Austin, Texas.

I originally wrote this crash course as an oral presentation to help better familiarize the staff with our beverage program. I constructed the website out of the notes and handouts that accompanied the presentation.

The class was a big success, leading to a 10% increase in amaro sales within a week.

This site was written locally on VS code using a hugo theme, similar to the RC Fabricaci√≥n project.

In this project I learned how to write the YAML from scratch rather than copying the example site from the hugo theme which much cleaner code. I found that rewarding. And I learned how to better utilize the GitHub desktop.

As an amaro enthusiast, I had fun working on this project and hope this little website goes on to help someone in need of a quick crash course on amaro in the future.
