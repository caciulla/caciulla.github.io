## Portfolio - Amaro Project

For this project I created a website that displays training material I created for a restaurant in Austin, Texas.

I originally wrote this crash course as an oral presentation to help better familiarize the staff with our beverage program.

The class was a big success, leading to a 10% increase in amaro sales within a week.

This site was written locally on VS code using a hugo theme, similar to the RC Fabricaci√≥n project. The photos are open source, stock images from unplash and pexels.

Also, in this project I learned how to write the JSON from sratch rather than relying on the example site from the hugo theme. I found that rewarding. I also learned how to better utlize the GitHub desktop.

As an amaro enthusiast, I found this project quite enjoyable and hope this little website goes on to help anyone in need of a quick crash course on amaro in the future.
