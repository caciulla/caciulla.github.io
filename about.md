## About Me 

I started by studying Graphic Design at a Technical Institute in Boston, Massachusetts. A year later, I switched majors and earned a Bachelor's Degree in Creative Writing and Psychology at Burlington College in Burlington, Vermont. 

I wrote human interest stories for a local newspaper called "The Vermont Times."

I graduated, moved to Austin, Texas, and started pursuing a career in writing. I wrote four novels and two novellas while bartending in fancy Italian restaurants. 

I moved to San Diego in 2020. During the commotion, I decided to make a change. I earned a certificate in Technical Writing in 2022 and began taking CS50x, Harvard's Introduction to Computer Science. I discovered that I love working with and around coding and new technologies. 

I like organizing and explaining new tech in ways that make it easy to grasp. I like writing in VS Code, using Markdown, collaborating through GitHub, using Jira and Confluence, and learning new programming languages.

I also love working on teams. I'm excited to work with other Technical Writers, Engineers, Developers, Product Managers, and other Subject Matter Experts excited about what the future will bring.
